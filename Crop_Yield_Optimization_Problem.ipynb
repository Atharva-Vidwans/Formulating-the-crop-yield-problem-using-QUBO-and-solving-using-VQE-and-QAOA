The problem here focuses not on profits but on the tonnage of crops harvested. Imagine you have a farm with three hectares of land suitable for farming. You need to choose which crops to plant from a selection of four. Furthermore, you also need to determine how many hectares of each you should plant. The four crops you can plant are wheat, soybeans, maize, and a push-pull crop. The fourth cannot be sold once harvested but it can help increase the yield of the other crops.\n",

This is can make the farm susceptible to disease and pests as the entire yield would be affected. In some instances, growing two different plants nearby each other will increase the yield of both, though sometimes it can decrease the yield. Intercropping is the process where different plants are chosen to _increase_ the yield. Push-Pull crops are pairs of plants that repel pests and attract pests respectively. Integrating them into a larger farm increases the yield of harvested food but with the cost of not necessarily being able to use the harvest of Push-Pull crops as part of the total yield.

In their general sense, they are NP-Hard; a class of problems that is difficult to solve using classical computational methods. In fact, the best classical method to solve these problems involves heuristics, a technique that finds an approximate solution. Quantum Computers have been shown to provide significant speed-up and better scaling for some heuristic problems. The crop-yield problem is a combinatorial problem, in that the solution is a specific combination of input parameters.
